\section{Conclusion}

For the tasks of SER, the CRNN model has a mediocre performance when 
classfying data in TESS, RAVDESS, and CREMA-D datasets. Moreover, it performs 
poorly on new unseen data. Although the CRNN model  achieved an overall 
poor performance compared to a simple CNN model, it is possible that 
better results could be achieved with more divserse data.
