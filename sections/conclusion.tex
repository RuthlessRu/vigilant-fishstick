\section{Conclusion}

For the tasks of SER, the CRNN model has demonstrated a mediocre performance when classifying data across the TESS, RAVDESS, and CREMA-D datasets.
Moreover, it heavily struggled with new unseen data. Although the CRNN model achieved overall poor performance compared to a simpler CNN model, itâ€™s
possible that better results could be obtained with more diverse data. Additionally, if we had more computing power to train the CRNN model using the audio
waves rather than relying on spectrograms, the CRNN model might have performed better, especially given the memory constraints we faced during this project.
