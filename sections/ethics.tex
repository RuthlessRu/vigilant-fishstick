\section{Ethical Considerations}
In utilizing the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS), we acknowledged several 
important ethical considerations regarding privacy, bias, and potential 
applications. While the dataset includes proper consent from the two female 
actors and is publicly available, we recognized that voice data is inherently 
personal and requires careful handling. The dataset has notable representation 
limitations: it only includes female voices, is limited to two age groups, and 
contains only English recordings from Canadian speakers, potentially affecting 
our model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, since the emotions are 
performed rather than naturally occurring, this may limit the applicability of 
our results in the real world. We also acknowledged that emotion recognition 
technology could potentially be misused for unauthorized surveillance or biased 
decision-making. To address these concerns, we committed to the following: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bias Mitigation: Recognizing the dataset's demographic limitations, we aimed to 
    use data augmentation techniques such as noise injection, time stretching, 
    and pitch to simulate a broader range of voices. However, 
    we were also transparent about the limitations that these techniques imposed, as 
    simulated diversity cannot truly replace real-world diversity in voice samples.

    \item Usage and Transparency: We committed to using the data solely for emotion 
    classification research, and openly addressed the challenges of using acted 
    emotion data and single-gender samples.    
\end{enumerate}
